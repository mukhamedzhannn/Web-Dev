    <h1>My best poem</h1>
    <p>The sun dipped low, a golden coin, Where earth and sky decide to join.<br> The shadows stretched across the grass, To watch the quiet evening pass.<br>

A silver moon began to rise, To brush the sleep from tired eyes, And though the world is fast asleep, There are promises the stars still keep.</p>
